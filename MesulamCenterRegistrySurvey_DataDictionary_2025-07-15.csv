In the survey, you will be asked questions about contact information, basic demographic information, medical history, and specific interests related to research activities. The survey will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. After you complete the survey, our staff will review your responses to see if you are eligible for any currently enrolling study or studies. If we determine that you are eligible, a staff member will contact you to discuss the study for which you are eligible. You can choose not to participate in a study for which you are eligible. If you complete the survey and are not contacted by a staff member, it is because we currently do not have any enrolling studies for which you are eligible. We will keep your information on file and will contact you in the future for any studies for which you are eligible.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>What happens if I do not want to be in this registry?</strong></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can decide not to participate in this registry and it will not be held against you.

Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution.</span></p> <p><strong>What happens to the information collected for the registry?</strong></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The survey is being hosted by Northwestern University and involves a secure connection. All information will be kept in a password-protected database only accessible by IRB-approved staff members within the Mesulam Center. The information collected for the registry will be accessible by all IRB-approved studies within the Mesulam Center. This way, you will be screened for all currently enrolling studies. When contacting you, the staff member will indicate which IRB-approved study they are screening you for.</span></p> <p><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>What else do I need to know?</strong></span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can begin the online survey and return to it at a later time.
